# Packing one through seven unit squares in a disk: the statement

This independent statement module imports only Mathlib. Its definitions are
copied word for word from Geometry.lean. The two declaration placeholders below
are the existing comparator challenge statements, not proof dependencies of the
solution; the root SquaresInCircles module supplies their actual proofs.

For every 1 <= n <= 7 the theorems identify the least disk radius and all
optimal packings. Cases 1 through 6 have one model up to the original rotation,
translation and relabeling congruence. Case 7 has the column-model family.
The exact six-square radical and its one rotated diagonal square are explicitly
defined below. Other n retain placeholder values and are outside theorem scope.

Closed squares may touch one another and the circle; only open interiors must
be disjoint. No parallelism, normalization, pin, sector, or separator assumption
is added to Packing. Congruent remains orientation-preserving: candidate
reflection symmetry is established by the solution, not built into the statement.

Membership in the closed disk of centre `o` and radius `R`, intended for
`0 ≤ R`. The squared form means `inDisk o R p` and `inDisk o (-R) p` agree, so
for negative `R` this is the disk of radius `|R|` rather than an empty set.
Every use here goes through `Packing`, whose first conjunct supplies `0 ≤ R`.
