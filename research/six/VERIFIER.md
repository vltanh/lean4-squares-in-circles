# n=6 reduced verifier

research/six/n6_reduced_verify.py is a diagnostic branch-and-bound driver for the
current normalized six-square state space.

## Important trust boundary

It is **not yet a proof certificate**.

The code uses ordinary IEEE-754 sin/cos evaluations, expanded by one ULP, to
guide subdivision and identify surviving branches. This is appropriate for
search and certificate discovery, but a final computer-assisted proof should
either:

1. replace the trigonometric bounds by rigorous rational/MPFI interval bounds
   and emit a replayable certificate, or
2. export the surviving finite certificate to Lean and prove the box
   exclusions there.

No search result from this script should be cited as the unrestricted n=6
proof until one of those steps is completed.

## State space

The global analytical reduction fixes one containing square C and five
exterior squares in cyclic order

    E, N, W, D, S.

The script uses 17 real coordinates:

    C_x, C_y,
    (phi_i, a_i, b_i) for i = E,N,W,D,S.

For an exterior square,

    center = a_i e(phi_i) + b_i J e(phi_i).

The initial global bounds are

    |C_x|, |C_y| <= 23/200
    177/200 <= a_i <= 223/200
    |b_i| <= 117/250

with each phi_i restricted to its primary-direction quadrant.

## Encoded analytical contractions

The current driver uses:

* exact candidate-radius containment formula
  (a+1/2)^2 + (|b|+1/2)^2;
* the five fixed open pins on the radius-9/10 auxiliary circle;
* the E/N versus southwest-foot classification;
* the simplified marker phi + 5 b / 4;
* consecutive marker gaps in [pi/3, 2pi/3];
* the 32 choices of central separator type (cardinal or own-primary);
* separating-axis overlap rejection for all ten outer-square pairs;
* the already-proved local, one-oblique-pair, and four-side/small-angle
  terminal branches.

research/six/PROGRESS.md records the mathematical provenance and limitations
of each reduction.

## Branch encoding

Bits are ordered

    E N W D S
    0 1 2 3 4

where bit 1 means that square uses its own primary edge normal as the
separator from the containing square, and bit 0 means the corresponding
cardinal normal.

The candidate branch is

    01000 (binary) = 8,

because only D uses its own primary normal.

## Usage

Quick diagnostic run:

    python research/six/n6_reduced_verify.py --branch 8 --max-nodes 100000

All 32 discrete branches:

    python research/six/n6_reduced_verify.py --branch all --max-nodes 1000000

Checkpoint one branch:

    python research/six/n6_reduced_verify.py \
      --branch 8 \
      --max-nodes 5000000 \
      --checkpoint /tmp/n6-branch8.json.gz \
      --checkpoint-every 100000

Resume:

    python research/six/n6_reduced_verify.py \
      --branch 8 \
      --resume /tmp/n6-branch8.json.gz \
      --checkpoint /tmp/n6-branch8.json.gz \
      --max-nodes 10000000

Write unresolved depth-limit boxes:

    python research/six/n6_reduced_verify.py \
      --branch 8 \
      --max-depth 56 \
      --survivors /tmp/n6-survivors.jsonl

## Current validation

Before upload, the script was syntax-checked with Python and run for a small
test tree on branch 8. That only checks basic execution; it is not evidence of
mathematical coverage.

The next implementation target is to replace the diagnostic trig interval
routine with an independently checkable enclosure and to add branch-specific
dual certificates for the small set of surviving boxes.


## Exact replay core

`research/six/n6_exact_interval.py` is the beginning of the independent replay
layer.  It contains no libm calls in the certificate arithmetic.

It provides:

* a rational enclosure of (pi) from Machin's identity
  (pi=16arctan(1/5)-4arctan(1/239));
* alternating-series bounds for the two arctangents;
* rational Taylor/Lagrange enclosures for sine and cosine at rational points;
* interval sine/cosine enclosures with exact critical-point accounting using
  the rational (pi) interval;
* an exact check that (q_*<Q_0=2.85118).

The intended architecture is now:

1. **fast discovery:** the floating-point driver finds a finite terminal cover
   and writes each box plus the rule that rejects it;
2. **exact replay:** rationally widen every recorded endpoint and verify the
   named rejection rule with `n6_exact_interval.py` primitives;
3. **Lean bridge:** either import the replayed finite certificate as explicit
   rational data and prove its checker sound in Lean, or translate the small
   remaining scalar certificate families directly into Lean.

The discovery run remains non-authoritative.  Only exact replay (and,
ultimately, its Lean soundness connection) is intended to enter the proof.
