# The statement: squares, disks, packings, congruence and the optimal models

Everything the main theorems (`SquaresInCircles.lean`) state: unit squares, each
with its own position and rotation; packings in a closed disk; congruence to a
model given about the origin; and the optimal radius and models of each case.
`Packing` asks only that the closed squares lie in the disk and that no point
lie in two open squares (`openSquare`, with strict inequalities).

`Challenge.lean` restates this file word for word, and Comparator checks that
the two elaborate identically. That needs every definition here, in this
order: Lean names the auxiliary lemmas inside a definition, such as the proof
of `Nat.AtLeastTwo 2` behind the real numeral `2`, after the first definition
in the file that needs them. Edit here only:
`scripts/verify-comparator.sh --write` copies the definitions into
`Challenge.lean`.

Membership in the closed disk of centre `o` and radius `R`, intended for
`0 ≤ R`. The squared form means `inDisk o R p` and `inDisk o (-R) p` agree, so
for negative `R` this is the disk of radius `|R|` rather than an empty set.
Every use here goes through `Packing`, whose first conjunct supplies `0 ≤ R`.

  normSq (sub p o) ≤ R ^ 2

/-- `n` unit squares packed in the closed disk of centre `o` and radius `R`:
the radius is nonnegative, every closed square lies in the closed disk, and no
point is interior to two different squares. -/

`S` is the configuration `M`, given about the origin, turned about the origin
by one angle `φ`, moved to `o`, and relabelled by `σ`: square `σ i` is exactly

set.

/-! ### The optimal radii and the optimal models

Every model is made of axis-parallel unit squares, with centres given in the
frame of the disk centre, which is the origin. -/

rectangle. -/

them. The disk centre is at height `5/16` above the lower pair. -/

side-neighbours. -/

/-- The optimal radius for seven unit squares: the distance from the disk centre
to the outer corners `(±3/2, ±1)` of the two side columns. -/

/-- How far a centre of the middle column can be from the disk centre: a unit
square centred at `(0, y)` lies in the disk of radius `√13 / 2` exactly when
`|y| ≤ √3 - 1/2`. -/
def columnLimit : ℝ := Real.sqrt 3 - 1 / 2

/-- The heights of the three centres of the middle column: at least 1 apart,
and within `columnLimit` of the disk centre. Every such triple occurs, so the
three middle squares can each move along the middle axis. -/
structure Column where
  bottom : ℝ
  middle : ℝ
  top : ℝ
  lower : -columnLimit ≤ bottom
  gap_lower : bottom + 1 ≤ middle
  gap_upper : middle + 1 ≤ top
  upper : top ≤ columnLimit

packing for `n ≤ 5`, and for `n = 7` every position of the three middle
squares. Every other `n` gets the placeholder `∅`, about which nothing is
claimed. -/
