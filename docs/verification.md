# Verification

```sh
lake exe cache get
lake build
lake env lean AxiomAudit.lean
lake env lean SanityChecks.lean
```

Requires Elan/Lake and network access for mathlib. The build uses Lean `4.34.0`
and mathlib `v4.34.0`. The source contains no `sorry`, no `axiom` declarations
and no `native_decide`.

- `lake build` must report zero `declaration uses 'sorry'` warnings.
- Every `#print axioms` line in the audit must read exactly
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
- `sorryAx` in that output would indicate an unproved lemma;
  `Lean.ofReduceBool` would indicate `native_decide` and compiler trust.
- The audit also prints `Packing`, `HasNormalForm`, `optimalRadius`,
  `modelCenters`, `optimalLayouts`, `Optimum`, the sliding column of seven
  squares and the theorem signatures for inspection.
- `SanityChecks.lean` checks the radius and centre tables, re-proves the exact
  rational margins and the contact points of the contact polygons that the
  proofs rely on, restates the public theorems, checks the five unique optimal
  packings against their normal forms, and checks the sliding family of seven
  squares and its normal form; it must elaborate without errors.

[`.github/workflows/lean.yml`](../.github/workflows/lean.yml) runs these steps
on every push to `main` and on pull requests, using `leanprover/lean-action`.
Its axiom audit covers every declaration under `SquaresInCircles`, not only the
ones printed by `AxiomAudit.lean`.

The proof pages in [`docs/proof/`](proof/README.md) link every Lean name they
cite to its declaration, by file and line.
[`scripts/link_lean.py`](../scripts/link_lean.py) regenerates these links, and
fails on a name that matches no declaration or more than one.
[`.github/workflows/docs.yml`](../.github/workflows/docs.yml) runs
`python3 scripts/link_lean.py --check` on every push to `main` and every pull
request that touches the Lean sources or the docs, and fails if a link is
stale. To refresh the links after changing a Lean file, run
`python3 scripts/link_lean.py` and commit the result. To have this done before
every commit, run `pre-commit install` once:
[`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](../.pre-commit-config.yaml) then refreshes the links
whenever a commit touches the Lean sources or the docs, and stops the commit if
any link moved, so that the refreshed pages can be staged.

Build from the committed `lake-manifest.json`, which pins every dependency by
hash. Avoid `lake update`: seven transitive packages track `main` or `master`
and would be re-resolved.

**Trusted base:** Lean, Lake, mathlib. Every numeric margin is an exact rational
inequality closed by `norm_num`, `linarith` or `nlinarith`; `π` enters only
through mathlib's rational bounds `3.14 < π < 3.1416` (and weaker ones such as
`3 < π`), and for seven squares also `3.1415 < π` and
`3.141592 < π < 3.141593`.
