# Preliminaries

[Back to the proof overview](README.md) · [Shared lemmas](common.md)

This page fixes the notation and restates the definitions that the main
theorem is stated with; their Lean text is on
[the definitions page](../definitions.md). The tools of the proofs are defined
on the [shared-lemmas page](common.md), each just before the lemmas that use
it. Each definition ends with the Lean declarations it corresponds to.

## Conventions

We work in the Euclidean plane: points are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$, with the
inner product $\langle p, q\rangle$ and the norm $|p|$. For a point $c$ and a
radius $r \ge 0$, the closed and the open disk of centre $c$ and radius $r$
are

```math
\overline{D}(c, r) = \lbrace p : |p - c| \le r \rbrace, \qquad D(c, r) = \lbrace p : |p - c| < r \rbrace .
```

A *direction* is an angle modulo $2\pi$. The unit vector in the direction
$\theta$ is $u(\theta) = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$, and the direction of a
nonzero vector $v$ is the $\theta$ with $v = |v| u(\theta)$.

## Unit squares

A unit square can sit anywhere in the plane and be turned any way. We describe
it through its own frame. Everything attached to a square carries its name:
its centre $c_S$, its frame $e^S_1, e^S_2$, and later $a_S$, $A_S$, $\theta_S$.

### Definition 1 (unit square)

A *unit square* $S$ is given by a centre $c_S$ and an orthonormal frame
$e^S_1, e^S_2$, with $e^S_2$ a quarter turn from $e^S_1$. The *local
coordinates* of a point $p$ are its coordinates in this frame,

```math
x_S(p) = \langle p - c_S,\ e^S_1\rangle, \qquad y_S(p) = \langle p - c_S,\ e^S_2\rangle ,
```

and in them $S$ is the standard square: its *open square* $S^\circ$ is the set
of points with $|x_S|, |y_S| < \frac12$, and its *closed square*
$\overline{S}$ the set with $|x_S|, |y_S| \le \frac12$. The vertices are
$c_S \pm \frac12 e^S_1 \pm \frac12 e^S_2$. Turning the frame by a quarter turn
gives the same sets, and every statement is about these sets.

*The frame of $S$ at its centre $c_S$, and the local coordinates of a point $p$.
The open square is where both are below $\frac12$ in absolute value.*

[`localY`](../../SquaresInCircles/Geometry.lean#L30),

[`closedSquare`](../../SquaresInCircles/Geometry.lean#L33).*

### Definition 2 (axis-parallel square)

For a point $c = (c_1, c_2)$, $Q(c)$ is the unit square with centre $c$ and the
standard frame, so that

```math
Q(c)^\circ = \lbrace (x, y) : |x - c_1| < \tfrac12,\ |y - c_2| < \tfrac12 \rbrace, \qquad
\overline{Q(c)} = \lbrace (x, y) : |x - c_1| \le \tfrac12,\ |y - c_2| \le \tfrac12 \rbrace .
```

The optimal packings are made of such squares.

*The square $Q(c)$ spans $c_1 \pm \frac12$ across and $c_2 \pm \frac12$ up.*

*Lean: [`axisSquare`](../../SquaresInCircles/Common/Constructions.lean#L9) for
$Q(c)$; [`openAxisSquare`](../../SquaresInCircles/Geometry.lean#L62) and
[`closedAxisSquare`](../../SquaresInCircles/Geometry.lean#L64) for the two
conditions above.*

## Packings and their normal forms

The main theorem is about unit squares packed in a disk. For each $n$ it names
the smallest radius and the packings that attain it: for $n \le 5$ one
packing, up to a rotation about the disk centre and a relabelling of the
squares, and for $n = 7$ a family in which the middle column slides.

### Definition 3 (packing)

Two squares $S$ and $T$ are *disjoint* if their open squares do not meet. A
*packing* of $n$ unit squares in the closed disk $\overline{D}(o, R)$ is a
family of $n$ pairwise disjoint unit squares whose closed squares lie in
$\overline{D}(o, R)$. The point $o$ is the *disk centre*.

*A packing of three unit squares in the closed disk of radius $R$ about $o$.*

*Lean: [`InteriorDisjoint`](../../SquaresInCircles/Common/Basic.lean#L39),
[`Packing`](../../SquaresInCircles/Geometry.lean#L49).*

### Definition 4 (frames at the disk centre)

To compare a packing with a model, we read it in coordinates centred at $o$.
For a direction $\phi$ let

```math
F_\phi(x, y) = o + x\,u(\phi) + y\,u\left(\phi + \tfrac\pi2\right),
```

the frame at $o$ whose first axis points in the direction $\phi$. A square $S$
*sits at $c$ in the frame $\phi$* if, in these coordinates, its open square is
$Q(c)^\circ$.

![Axes at o turned by the angle phi, and a square aligned with them whose centre is reached by going c1 along the first axis and c2 along the second](figures/frame.svg)

*The frame $F_\phi$ at $o$. The square sits at $c = (c_1, c_2)$: in these
coordinates it is $Q(c)$.*

*Lean: [`pointInDirection`](../../SquaresInCircles/Geometry.lean#L58),
[`Represents`](../../SquaresInCircles/Common/NormalForm.lean#L16).*

### Definition 5 (normal form)

A packing $S_1, \dots, S_n$ has the *normal form* of the points
$c_1, \dots, c_n$ if, for one direction $\phi$ and one relabelling $\sigma$,
each $S_{\sigma(i)}$ sits at $c_i$ in the frame $\phi$, for the open and the
closed squares alike. In words: one rotation about $o$ and one relabelling
carry the model squares $Q(c_1), \dots, Q(c_n)$, placed with their disk centre
at $o$, onto the packing.

![The T packing turned about o by an angle phi, inside its dashed circle, with the squares labelled S2, S3 and S1](figures/normal-form.svg)

*A packing in the normal form of the T. Turning the model by $\phi$ about $o$
gives the packing; the square in slot $c_i$ is $S_{\sigma(i)}$, here with
$\sigma(1) = 2$, $\sigma(2) = 3$, $\sigma(3) = 1$.*

*Lean: [`HasNormalForm`](../../SquaresInCircles/Geometry.lean#L72).*

With these definitions the main theorem can be stated; it is on the
[overview page](README.md#the-main-theorem).
