# Seven squares

[Back to the proof overview](README.md) · [Preliminaries](preliminaries.md) · [Shared lemmas](common.md)

**Theorem 7.** Let $R_7 = \frac{\sqrt{13}}2$, and let $c_1, \dots, c_7$ be the
points $(1, -\frac12)$, $(1, \frac12)$, $(-1, -\frac12)$, $(-1, \frac12)$,
$(0, -1)$, $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$.

1. $Q(c_1), \dots, Q(c_7)$ form a packing in the closed disk of radius $R_7$
   about the origin: a column of three squares between two columns of two.
   More generally the middle column can slide: for any $y_1, y_2, y_3$ with
   $y_1 + 1 \le y_2$, $y_2 + 1 \le y_3$ and
   $-(\sqrt3 - \frac12) \le y_1$, $y_3 \le \sqrt3 - \frac12$, the squares
   $Q(\pm1, \pm\frac12)$, $Q(0, y_1)$, $Q(0, y_2)$, $Q(0, y_3)$ form such a
   packing.
2. A packing of seven unit squares in a closed disk of radius $R$ forces
   $R \ge R_7$.
3. The packings of seven unit squares in a closed disk of radius $R_7$ are
   exactly the configurations with the normal form of $(\pm1, \pm\frac12)$,
   $(0, y_1)$, $(0, y_2)$, $(0, y_3)$ for some $y_1, y_2, y_3$ as in (1).

So the optimum is not unique: by (1) the optimal packings form a
three-parameter family, with infinitely many packings that no rotation and
relabelling carry onto one another. By (3) there are no others.

![The packing of seven squares in its dashed circle of radius root 13 over 2: a grey middle square around the centre, one square above and one below it, and two squares on either side; the unit circle about the centre is divided into six coloured arcs of 60 degrees, one in each square other than the middle one](figures/seven.svg)

*Seven squares. The unit circle $\Gamma_1$ about the disk centre $o$ splits
into six arcs of exactly 60°, one in each square that avoids $o$; the middle
square (grey) contains $o$. The centres of the six arcs are the markers of
Definition 7.4, at 30°, 90°, …, 330°.*

*Sketch.* The work is part (3), at the radius $R_7$ itself; part (2) follows
from it. Each square that avoids the disk centre gets a marker, a direction
from the disk centre computed from where the centre lies relative to the
square. The pair theorem is the heart of the proof: it places two disjoint
squares in a normal position, computes their shadows on the four edge
directions exactly, and shows that the shadows overlap when the markers are
less than $\frac\pi3$ apart, and also at exactly $\frac\pi3$ unless the squares
touch as in (1). Seven markers do not fit, so one square contains the centre.
The markers of the other six form a regular hexagon, and neighbouring squares
touch as in (1), which rebuilds the packing up to the position of the middle
column. A packing in a smaller disk would also be a packing at radius $R_7$,
but all of those reach the circle of radius $R_7$; this gives (2).

Unlike three to five squares, the argument is about pairs of squares rather
than arcs of a single circle, and it uses the disk only through
$\varphi(a_S, b_S) \le \frac{13}4$.

## Construction

### Proposition 7.1 (the sliding packings)

For $y_1, y_2, y_3$ as in Theorem 7, the squares $Q(\pm1, \pm\frac12)$,
$Q(0, y_1)$, $Q(0, y_2)$, $Q(0, y_3)$ are pairwise disjoint and lie in the
closed disk of radius $R_7$ about the origin. With $(y_1, y_2, y_3) =
(-1, 0, 1)$ they are $Q(c_1), \dots, Q(c_7)$.

*Proof.* Any two of the centres differ by at least 1 in one coordinate. The
side squares lie in $[-\frac32, \frac32] \times [-1, 1]$ and the middle ones in
$[-\frac12, \frac12] \times [-\sqrt3, \sqrt3]$, and

```math
\tfrac94 + 1 = \tfrac14 + 3 = \tfrac{13}4 = R_7^2 .
```

Apply [Lemma 17](common.md#lemma-17-axis-parallel-squares). $\square$

The four outer corners $(\pm\frac32, \pm1)$ lie on the circle. The middle
squares reach it only at the ends of their range, so the column has
$2\sqrt3 - 3$ of slack in total.

## Uniqueness

### Proposition 7.2 (uniqueness)

If seven pairwise disjoint unit squares lie in the closed disk of radius $R_7$
about $o$, the packing has the normal form of $(\pm1, \pm\frac12)$,
$(0, y_1)$, $(0, y_2)$, $(0, y_3)$ for some $y_1, y_2, y_3$ as in Theorem 7.

The proof takes five steps.

1. **States and markers.** Each square that does not contain $o$ has a state
   in a region of the $(a, u)$-plane, and a marker.
2. **The marker arc.** Each such square holds a closed arc of the unit circle
   about its marker.
3. **The pair theorem.** Two disjoint such squares have markers at least
   $\frac\pi3$ apart, and exactly $\frac\pi3$ apart only when they touch as in
   the packings of Theorem 7.
4. **The ring.** Seven markers do not fit, so some square contains $o$. The
   markers of the other six form a regular hexagon, and going round it each
   square touches the next in a fixed pattern. That pattern rebuilds the two
   side columns and puts one square above $o$ and one below, each at a free
   height.
5. **The middle column.** The side columns pin the square that contains $o$ to
   the middle column, where it can slide too.

[`Seven.classification_by_slots`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Uniqueness.lean#L125).*

### Step 1. States and markers

For an exterior square $S$ take a chart $(\theta_S, \varepsilon_S)$
([Lemma 10](common.md#lemma-10-charts)). In it $S$ is the axis-parallel square
centred at $(a_S, b_S)$, with $a_S \ge b_S \ge 0$ and $a_S \ge \frac12$. From
here on only these two numbers and the orientation matter.

#### Definition 7.3 (states)

A *state* is a pair $(a, u)$ with $\frac12 \le a$ and $0 \le u \le a$. It is
*admissible* if $\varphi(a, u) \le \frac{13}4$. Its *remainder* is

```math
r(a, u) = 4 - 3a - 2u = (a - 1)^2 + \left(u - \tfrac12\right)^2 + \tfrac{13}4 - \varphi(a, u) .
```

By [Lemma 1](common.md#lemma-1-farthest-vertex), in the closed disk of radius
$R_7$ every exterior square has an admissible state $(a_S, b_S)$. The identity
says that $r \ge 0$ is the tangent half-plane of $\varphi = \frac{13}4$ at
$(1, \frac12)$ ([Lemma 2](common.md#lemma-2-tangent-lines)). In the packing of
Theorem 7 the four side squares have the state $(1, \frac12)$ and the top and
bottom squares $(1, 0)$; sliding the column turns the latter into $(y, 0)$ with
$\frac52 - \sqrt3 \le y \le \sqrt3 - \frac12$.

*Lean: [`Seven.Admissible`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Labels.lean#L22),
[`Seven.remainder`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Labels.lean#L19),
[`Seven.remainder_identity`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Labels.lean#L28),
[`Seven.chart_admissible`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Labels.lean#L231).*

#### Definition 7.4 (labels and markers)

For a state $(a, u)$ let

```math
\mathrm{axial}(u) = \tfrac54 u, \qquad
\mathrm{side}(a, u) = \tfrac\pi6 + \tfrac13\left(u - \tfrac12\right) + \tfrac34(1 - a), \qquad
\ell(a, u) = \min\left(\mathrm{axial}(u), \mathrm{side}(a, u), \tfrac\pi4\right) .
```

$\ell$ is the *label*; it is *axial*, *side* or *capped* when the first,
second or third term attains the minimum, and *active* when it is axial or
side. A tie counts for every term that attains the minimum, so a label equal to
$\frac\pi4$ can be both capped and active. The *marker* of an exterior square
$S$ is the direction $\theta_S + \varepsilon_S\,\ell(a_S, b_S)$. It depends
on the chart only when $a_S = b_S$, where $S$ has two charts; everything below
holds for either choice.

The label is an angle measured in the chart from the phase, towards the
centre of $S$. In the optimal packing the side squares have
$\ell = \mathrm{side}(1, \frac12) = \frac\pi6$ and the top and bottom
squares $\ell = \mathrm{axial}(0) = 0$, which puts the six markers at
30°, 90°, …, 330°, exactly $\frac\pi3$ apart (figure above). The axial and side
labels agree on the line $9a + 11u = 2\pi + 7$, which meets the circle
$\varphi = \frac{13}4$ at the *transition state*
$(a_0, u_0) \approx (1.1198, 0.2914)$, of label $s_0 = \frac54 u_0 \approx 0.364$.

*Lean: [`Seven.axial`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Labels.lean#L16),

[`Seven.Boundary.u0`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/LabelBoundary.lean#L20),
[`Seven.Boundary.s0`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/LabelBoundary.lean#L21).*

#### Lemma 7.5 (the label)

Let $(a, u)$ be admissible. Then $3a + 2u \le 4$, $a < \frac54$,
$u < \frac{31}{40}$ and $0 \le \ell(a, u) \le \frac\pi4$, with $\ell = 0$ only
if $u = 0$. Moreover

```math
\mathrm{side}(a, u) = \tfrac\pi6 + \tfrac56\left(u - \tfrac12\right) + \tfrac14 r(a, u)
= \tfrac\pi6 - \tfrac54(a - 1) - \tfrac16 r(a, u) .
```

*Proof.* The first inequality is $r \ge 0$, and the two bounds follow from
$\varphi(a, u) \le \frac{13}4$ with $u \ge 0$ and $u \le a$. The label is a
minimum of three nonnegative terms, one of which is $\frac\pi4$, and
$\mathrm{axial}(u) = 0$ only at $u = 0$, while the side label is
positive. The identities are the definition of $r$. $\square$

### Step 2. The marker arc

#### Lemma 7.6 (the marker arc)

Let $(a, u)$ be admissible and $|t - \ell(a, u)| \le \frac{801}{1600}$. Then

```math
|\cos t - a| \le \tfrac12 , \qquad |\sin t - u| \le \tfrac12 .
```

So an exterior square $S$ with an admissible state holds, in its closed
square, the arc of the unit circle $\Gamma_1$ of half-width
$\frac{801}{1600} \approx 28.7°$ about its marker. At the optimal packing the
arcs of the figure have half-width exactly $\frac\pi6 \approx 30°$.

*Proof.* In the chart, the point $(\cos t, \sin t)$ must stay between the
four edge lines of $Q(a, u)$. For the lower and the upper edge we use that
$\frac54 y - \arcsin y$ increases on $[-\frac35, \frac35]$ and decreases on
$[\frac35, 1]$, since its derivative is $\frac54 - 1/\sqrt{1 - y^2}$.

- *The far edge* $x = a + \frac12$ is out of reach, since $a \ge \frac12$.
- *The near edge* $x = a - \frac12$: we need
  $\ell + \frac{801}{1600} < \arccos(a - \frac12)$. By the radial form of the
  side label and $\varphi \le \frac{13}4$, $\ell + \arcsin(a - \frac12)$ is at
  most an explicit function of $x = a - \frac12 \in [0, \frac34]$,

  ```math
  \tfrac\pi6 + \tfrac1{24} + \tfrac13\sqrt{\tfrac{13}4 - (x + 1)^2} + \arcsin x - \tfrac34 x .
  ```

  This envelope is concave, since its second derivative is negative: its
  sign is that of minus an explicit polynomial with positive Bernstein
  coefficients. So it lies below its tangent at $x = \frac18$, where its value
  is below $\frac\pi6 + 0.543$ by
  [Lemma 16](common.md#lemma-16-elementary-estimates) (3) and its slope lies in
  $[-\frac1{100}, 0]$. On $[0, \frac34]$ that tangent stays below
  $\frac\pi6 + 0.5443 < \frac\pi2 - \frac{801}{1600}$.
- *The lower edge* $y = u - \frac12$: we need
  $\arcsin(u - \frac12) + \frac{801}{1600} < \ell$. Each of the three terms of
  $\ell$ exceeds the left side: the axial one because
  $\frac54 u - \arcsin(u - \frac12)$ increases from $\frac\pi6$ at $u = 0$, the
  side one by $\arcsin y \le y + \frac14\left(\frac{11}{40}\right)^3$ for
  $y = u - \frac12 < \frac{11}{40}$ and a Cauchy–Schwarz bound on
  $\frac34(a + \frac12) + \frac23(u + \frac12)$, and $\frac\pi4$ because
  $u < \frac{31}{40}$. The bound on $\arcsin$ is $\arcsin y \le y$ for
  $y \le 0$, since $\arcsin$ is odd, and $\arcsin y \le y + \frac{y^3}4$ for
  $y \ge 0$ ([Lemma 16](common.md#lemma-16-elementary-estimates) (2) and (3)).
- *The upper edge* $y = u + \frac12$ matters only when $u \le \frac12$, and
  then $\ell + \frac{801}{1600} < \arcsin(u + \frac12)$ follows from
  $\ell \le \frac54 u$, since $\frac54 y - \arcsin y$ is largest at
  $y = \frac35$ and $\arcsin\frac35 > 0.63$. $\square$

### Step 3. The pair theorem

This step compares two exterior squares with states $(a, u)$ and $(A, v)$ and
orientations $s, t \in \lbrace 1, -1 \rbrace$. Put the first in its chart; the
second is then turned relative to it by the angle between the two phases.

#### Definition 7.7 (support function)

For a point $(a, b)$ and a direction $z$ let

```math
h(a, b, z) = a\cos z + b\sin z + \tfrac12\left(|\cos z| + |\sin z|\right)
= \max_{p \in \overline{Q(a, b)}} \langle p,\ u(z)\rangle ,
```

the support function of the axis-parallel unit square centred at $(a, b)$.

*Lean: [`Seven.support`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Support.lean#L15),
[`Seven.point_le_support`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Support.lean#L18).*

#### Definition 7.8 (canonical pair and support sums)

Given two states $(a, u)$, $(A, v)$, signs $s, t$ and a gap $g \ge 0$, let

```math
d = g + s\,\ell(a, u) - t\,\ell(A, v) .
```

The *canonical pair* is $S = Q(a, su)$ and the unit square $T$ whose frame is
turned by $d$ and which sits at $(A, tv)$ in that frame. The markers of $S$
and $T$ are the directions $s\ell(a, u)$ and $d + t\ell(A, v)$: they are $g$
apart. For $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$ the *support sum* on the $k$-th axis is

```math
\sigma_k(g) = h\left(a, su, k\tfrac\pi2\right) + h\left(A, tv, k\tfrac\pi2 + \pi - d\right)
= \max_{\overline S}\,\langle \cdot, n_k\rangle - \min_{\overline T}\,\langle \cdot, n_k\rangle ,
```

where $n_k = u(k\frac\pi2)$ is the outer normal of the $k$-th edge of $S$. In
the chart of $S$, whose disk centre is the origin, $n_0$ points away from the
centre and $n_2$ towards it, $n_1$ points in the direction of increasing angle,
towards the marker of $T$, and $n_3$ the other way.

[`Seven.relativePhase`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/PairModel.lean#L129),
[`Seven.pair_support_axis_values`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/PairModel.lean#L140).*

#### Lemma 7.9 (separating axes)

If the open squares of a canonical pair are disjoint, then $\sigma_k(g) \le 0$
for some $k$, for the pair or for the pair seen from $T$.

*Proof.* Suppose all these support sums are positive. $\sigma_k > 0$ and
$\sigma_{k+2} > 0$ say that the open shadows of $S$ and $T$ on the line of $n_k$
overlap, so the shadows overlap on both axes of $S$. Reversing the pair and
reflecting it, which exchanges the two squares and both signs but keeps $d$,
gives the same for the two axes of $T$. If $S$ and $T$ were disjoint,
[Lemma 5](common.md#lemma-5-supporting-line) would give a normal $n$ with
$w_S(n) + w_T(n) \le \langle n, c_T - c_S\rangle$. Writing $c_T - c_S$ in the
frame of $S$, the four strict overlaps bound $\langle n, c_T - c_S\rangle$
strictly by the octagon
$\frac12(|n_1| + |n_2| + |c\,n_1 + s\,n_2| + |{-s}\,n_1 + c\,n_2|) = w_S(n) + w_T(n)$,
where $(c, s)$ is the relative frame: a weighted sum of two of the four
overlaps, with the weights read off the quadrant of $n$. This is the
separating-axis theorem for two squares. $\square$

[`Seven.reverse_center_coordinates`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/CanonicalPair.lean#L61).*

#### Definition 7.10 (contacts)

A state is a *side state* if it is $(1, \frac12)$, and an *axial state* if it
is $(a, 0)$ with $\frac12 \le a \le \sqrt3 - \frac12$. States $(a, u)$ and
$(A, v)$ with signs $s$ and $t$ form a *contact* if

1. $s = -1$, $t = +1$, and both states are side states; or
2. $s = +1$, $(a, u)$ is a side state and $(A, v)$ is axial; or
3. $t = -1$, $(a, u)$ is axial and $(A, v)$ is a side state.

Going counterclockwise round a packing of Theorem 7, these are the three ways
in which an exterior square touches the next one: (1) the first square of a
side column touches the second, (2) a side column touches the top or bottom
square, and (3) the top or bottom square touches the next side column. The
label of a side state is $\frac\pi6$ and that of an axial state is $0$, so no
state in a contact has a capped label.

[`Seven.contact_label_not_cap`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Contacts.lean#L48).*

#### Proposition 7.11 (the gap of $\frac\pi3$)

Let $(a, u)$ and $(A, v)$ be admissible. Then $\sigma_k(\frac\pi3) \ge 0$ for
every $k$ and all signs, with equality only if the two states with these signs
form a contact.

*Proof.* First the capped labels. On the triangle where $\ell = \frac\pi4$, cut
out by $\pi \le 5u$ and $9a - 4u \le 7 - \pi$, the label is constant, so
$\sigma_k$ is affine in the state. Its three vertices $(\frac\pi5, \frac\pi5)$,
$(\frac{7 - \pi/5}9, \frac\pi5)$ and $(\frac{7 - \pi}5, \frac{7 - \pi}5)$ are
admissible and have active labels (axial or side equal to $\frac\pi4$). So
$\sigma_k$ at a capped state is a convex combination of its values at the
vertices, hence at least one of them. It is therefore nonnegative, and if it
vanishes, it vanishes at a vertex, which would then be in a contact with a
capped label. It remains to treat active labels, sector by sector:

| axis | signs $(s, t)$ | labels | argument |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $n_0$, outward | all | all | $\sigma_0 = a + \frac12 + h_T > 1 + \frac12 - \frac{31}{25} > 0$, since $T$'s centre is within $\frac{31}{25}$ of the origin |
| $n_3$, backward | all | all | $T$ contains its marker point, which reaches past $S$ |
| $n_2$, inward | $(-, \pm)$ | all | $T$'s marker arc (Lemma 7.6) reaches past $S$ |
| $n_2$, inward | $(+, +)$ | both axial | for a nonnegative turn between the labels a linear clearance; for a negative turn $-z$ the profile $\sin z - \frac45 z\cos z - \frac34(1 - \cos z) \ge \frac z{50}$ on $[0, \frac\pi2]$ |
| $n_2$, inward | $(+, +)$ | side, axial | at least a multiple of the remainder of $S$ plus a multiple of the absolute turn, by the same profile; zero only at a contact (2) |
| $n_2$, inward | $(+, +)$ | any, side | concave in the first label; the endpoints $0$ and $\frac\pi4$ |
| $n_2$, inward | $(+, -)$ | active | exact formula; minima on the boundary curves of the label regions; a two-circle quadratic certificate; zero only at a contact (2) |
| $n_1$, forward | $(+, +)$ | all | the centre bound of the first row when $\ell(a, u) \ge \frac5{16}$; otherwise Cauchy–Schwarz on the disk, $\cos + \sin$ increasing on $[0, \frac\pi4]$, and concavity in the label |
| $n_1$, forward | $(+, -)$, and $(-, -)$ with $S$ axial | active | the support of $T$ bounded by Cauchy–Schwarz on its disk, or at medium turns by the tangent of the disk at the transition state, then profiles in the turn; zero only at a contact (3) |
| $n_1$, forward | $(-, +)$ | active | a Cauchy–Schwarz certificate for two side labels, zero only at a contact (1); linear clearances for the others |
| $n_1$, forward | $(-, -)$, $S$ side | active | the target support is minimised along exact label segments; its circular piece is concave |

In each sector $\sigma_k$ is written in closed form, reduced by monotonicity
or concavity to the boundary of the label region, and bounded below by a
function of one angle. Linear forms in a state are bounded on the disk
$\varphi \le \frac{13}4$ by Cauchy–Schwarz. The function of one angle is
compared with Taylor polynomials of $\sin$ and $\cos$ of degree up to 7, and
the resulting polynomial is shown positive by its coefficients in a Bernstein
basis or by an exact identity; a few profiles are positive by concavity between
their endpoints, or from one value together with a curvature bound. $\pi$
enters only through bounds, the sharpest being $3.141592 < \pi < 3.141593$.

Where the table allows a zero, the lower bound is a sum of nonnegative terms,
among them a remainder $r$ of Definition 7.3 and the turn between the two
labels, and a zero makes both vanish. By the identity of Definition 7.3,
$r(a, u) = 0$ with $\varphi(a, u) \le \frac{13}4$ forces $(a, u) = (1, \frac12)$.
The turn then fixes the other label, which makes the other state a side state
or gives it transverse coordinate 0; an admissible state $(A, 0)$ is axial,
since $\varphi(A, 0) \le \frac{13}4$ gives $A \le \sqrt3 - \frac12$. $\square$

So $\sigma_k(\frac\pi3)$ vanishes only where two squares touch as in the
optimal packing: the two squares of a side column, or a side square and the
top or bottom square. In the second case the equality fixes the side state
$(1, \frac12)$ and puts the other square on the axis, $v = 0$, but leaves its
height $A$ free, as the sliding column requires.

#### Lemma 7.12 (small gaps)

Let $(a, u)$ and $(A, v)$ be admissible and $0 \le g \le 1$. Then
$\sigma_k(g) > 0$ for every $k$ and all signs.

*Proof.* By Lemma 7.6 the closed squares $\overline S$ and $\overline T$ hold
the arcs of $\Gamma_1$ of half-width $\frac{801}{1600}$ about their markers,
which are $g \le 1$ apart. Both arcs therefore contain the three points of
$\Gamma_1$ in the directions $m$ and $m \pm \frac1{3200}$, where $m$ is the
midpoint of the markers. If $\sigma_k(g) \le 0$, the line of $n_k$ through the
top of $\overline S$ would separate the two closed squares weakly, and all
three points would lie on it. A line meets a circle in at most two points.
$\square$

#### Lemma 7.13 (the minimum of a support sum)

Let $(a, u)$ and $(A, v)$ be admissible, and suppose that $\sigma_k(1) > 0$,
$\sigma_k(\frac\pi3) \ge 0$ and $\sigma_k(y) \le 0$ for some
$y \in [1, \frac\pi3)$. Let $g$ be the leftmost point of $[1, \frac\pi3]$ where
$\sigma_k$ attains its minimum. Then $1 < g < \frac\pi3$ and $\sigma_k(g) > 0$,
a contradiction.

*Proof.* The minimum is at most $\sigma_k(y) \le 0$, so $g \ne 1$; and
$g = \frac\pi3$ would give $\sigma_k(\frac\pi3) = 0$, which makes $y$ a
minimum further left. Only the second term of
$\sigma_k$ depends on $g$, through the direction $z = k\frac\pi2 + \pi - d$,
and $-\frac\pi2 < d < \pi$.

- *Parallel sides.* If $\sin z = 0$ or $\cos z = 0$, then $d = 0$ or
  $d = \frac\pi2$: the sides of the two squares are parallel. Then $\sigma_k$
  is 1 plus or minus a difference of centre coordinates, and it can fail to be
  positive only if the squares lie side by side across the axis. That is
  excluded by the labels. Two labels on opposite sides with $u + v \ge 1$ add
  up to at least $\frac\pi3$, and $d = 0$ would make $g$ equal to their sum.
  When $d = \frac\pi2$, a separation by a whole side forces
  $s\ell(a, u) - t\ell(A, v) \le \frac\pi6$, and then
  $g = \frac\pi2 - s\ell(a, u) + t\ell(A, v) \ge \frac\pi3$. Both contradict
  $g < \frac\pi3$.
- *A smooth minimum.* Otherwise $h(A, tv, z)$ is a sinusoid
  $X\cos z + Y\sin z$ near $g$, where $(X, Y)$ is a vertex of $T$. By
  Fermat's theorem its derivative vanishes, and a comparison with a point to
  the left, where $\sigma_k$ is strictly larger, shows that
  $X\cos z + Y\sin z < 0$. So $u(z)$ points away from the vertex of $T$
  nearest to the origin, at distance $\delta = |(X, Y)| < \frac12$, and the
  term equals $-\delta$. The first term, the support of $S$, exceeds
  $\delta$: on the axes where it could be small, the side label of $T$ and
  the axial label of $S$ bound the angles, and elementary estimates for
  $\sin$ and $\cos$ finish. $\square$

The leftmost choice matters when $\sigma_k$ is constant on a stretch: then no
point of the stretch but its left end is a leftmost minimum.

#### Theorem 7.14 (all gaps)

Let $(a, u)$ and $(A, v)$ be admissible and $0 \le g < \frac\pi3$. Then
$\sigma_k(g) > 0$ for every $k$ and all signs.

*Proof.* Lemma 7.12 covers $g \le 1$. For $g > 1$, if $\sigma_k(g) \le 0$,
then $\sigma_k(1) > 0$ (Lemma 7.12), $\sigma_k(\frac\pi3) \ge 0$
(Proposition 7.11), and Lemma 7.13 gives a contradiction. $\square$

#### Theorem 7.15 (marker separation)

Let $S$ and $T$ be disjoint exterior squares with
$\varphi(a_S, b_S) \le \frac{13}4$ and $\varphi(a_T, b_T) \le \frac{13}4$.
Then their markers are at least $\frac\pi3$ apart. If the marker of $T$ is
exactly $\frac\pi3$ ahead of that of $S$, their states and signs
$\varepsilon_S$, $\varepsilon_T$ form a contact.

*Proof.* Suppose the marker of $T$ is $g \in [0, \frac\pi3]$ ahead of that of
$S$; otherwise swap them. Let $s = \varepsilon_S$ and $t = \varepsilon_T$. By
[Lemma 11](common.md#lemma-11-cartesian-form-of-a-chart), $S$ sits at
$(a_S, s\,b_S)$ in the frame $\theta_S$ and $T$ at $(a_T, t\,b_T)$ in the frame
$\theta_T$, and $\theta_T - \theta_S = d$ because the markers are $g$ apart.
So, read in the frame $\theta_S$, the two squares are the canonical pair of
their states. They are disjoint, so by Lemma 7.9 some support sum is at most
0, for the pair or for the pair seen from $T$, which is the canonical pair of
the two states in reverse order with both signs flipped. For $g < \frac\pi3$
this contradicts Theorem 7.14. For $g = \frac\pi3$ that sum is 0 by
Proposition 7.11, which then gives a contact. A contact of the reversed pair
with flipped signs is a contact of the pair itself. $\square$

### Step 4. The ring

#### Lemma 7.16 (a square contains the centre)

1. Seven directions cannot be pairwise at least $\frac\pi3$ apart.
2. In a packing of seven unit squares in a closed disk of radius $R_7$ about
   $o$, some square contains $o$.

*Proof.* (1) The closed arcs of half-width $\frac12$ about them would be
pairwise disjoint, since $\frac\pi3 > 1$, and have total length $7 > 2\pi$
([Lemma 7](common.md#lemma-7-angular-budget)). (2) Otherwise all seven squares
are exterior, with admissible states by
[Lemma 1](common.md#lemma-1-farthest-vertex), and Theorem 7.15 puts their
markers pairwise at least $\frac\pi3$ apart, against (1). $\square$

*Lean:
[`Seven.seven_directions_impossible`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Uniqueness.lean#L28),
[`Seven.exists_containing`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Uniqueness.lean#L44).*

#### Proposition 7.17 (the ring)

Let six pairwise disjoint exterior squares have admissible states. Then in
some frame at $o$ they sit, in some order, at

```math
(1, -\tfrac12),\quad (1, \tfrac12),\quad (0, h),\quad (-1, \tfrac12),\quad (-1, -\tfrac12),\quad (0, -k)
```

for some $h$ and $k$ with $\frac12 \le h, k \le \sqrt3 - \frac12$.

*Proof.* By Theorem 7.15 the six markers are pairwise at least $\frac\pi3$
apart, so by [Lemma 20](common.md#lemma-20-regular-polygons) with six
directions and $g = \frac\pi3$ they form a regular hexagon: in some order they
are $\phi + i\frac\pi3$ for $i = 0, \dots, 5$. Each marker is exactly
$\frac\pi3$ ahead of the one before, so by Theorem 7.15 each square and the
next one counterclockwise form a contact. Call a square with a side state
*lower* if its sign is $-1$ and *upper* if it is $+1$. By Definition 7.10,
after a lower square comes an upper one, after an upper one an axial one, and
after an axial one a lower one. So round the hexagon the kinds are lower,
upper, axial, lower, upper, axial. The labels are $\frac\pi6$ and $0$, so the
markers fix the phases: they are $\theta$, $\theta$, $\theta + \frac\pi2$,
$\theta + \pi$, $\theta + \pi$, $\theta + \frac{3\pi}2$ for the phase $\theta$
of the first lower square. By
[Lemma 11](common.md#lemma-11-cartesian-form-of-a-chart) each square sits, in
the frame of its own phase, at $(1, -\frac12)$ if lower, at $(1, \frac12)$ if
upper, and at $(a, 0)$ if axial. Turning back to the frame $\theta$ by
[Lemma 18](common.md#lemma-18-sitting-at-a-centre) (2) gives the six points;
$h$ and $k$ are the first coordinates of the two axial states, and
Definition 7.10 bounds them. $\square$

### Step 5. The middle column

#### Lemma 7.18 (the square in the middle)

Let $S$ contain $o$, and let four squares disjoint from $S$ sit at
$(\pm1, \pm\frac12)$ in a frame $\phi$ at $o$. Then $S$ sits at $(0, z)$ in the
frame $\phi$, with $|z| < \frac12$.

*Proof.* Work in the frame $\phi$. Every point $(x, y)$ of $S^\circ$ with
$|y| < 1$ has $|x| \le \frac12$. Otherwise the point of the segment from $o$ to
$(x, y)$ with $|x'| = \frac12$, which lies in $S^\circ$, has $|y'| < 1$ and so
lies in one of the closed side squares, against
[Lemma 5](common.md#lemma-5-supporting-line) (2). The centre of $S$ is within
$\frac1{\sqrt2}$ of $o$, so the line through it parallel to the first axis
lies in the band $|y| < 1$. If $S$ were tilted, the chord of $S^\circ$ along
that line would be longer than 1, which does not fit in $|x| \le \frac12$. So
the sides of $S$ are parallel to the axes, its centre is on $x = 0$, and
$|z| < \frac12$ because $S$ contains $o$. $\square$

[`Seven.section_strip_rigidity`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Uniqueness/CentralSquare.lean#L47).*

*Proof of Proposition 7.2.* By Lemma 7.16 some square contains $o$. The other
six are exterior, with admissible states by Lemma 1, and Proposition 7.17
places them in a frame $\phi$; Lemma 7.18 places the seventh at $(0, z)$ in the
same frame. The squares at $(0, -k)$, $(0, z)$ and $(0, h)$ are disjoint and
sit on one axis of the frame, so $-k + 1 \le z$ and $z + 1 \le h$. With
$h, k \le \sqrt3 - \frac12$ these are the conditions of Theorem 7 for
$(y_1, y_2, y_3) = (-k, z, h)$, and
[Lemma 19](common.md#lemma-19-from-slots-to-a-normal-form) gives the normal
form. $\square$

*Lean:
[`Seven.normal_form_of_containing`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Uniqueness.lean#L71),
[`Seven.column_centers_separated`](../../SquaresInCircles/Seven/Uniqueness.lean#L59).*

Proposition 7.1 and [Lemma 21](common.md#lemma-21-normal-forms-of-a-packing)
give the converse: every configuration with this normal form is a packing in
the closed disk of radius $R_7$.

## Lower bound

*Proof of Theorem 7 (2).* Every layout of Theorem 7 (1) has the square
$Q(1, -\frac12)$, whose corner $(\frac32, -1)$ lies on the circle of radius
$R_7$, since $\frac94 + 1 = \frac{13}4$. By Proposition 7.2 every packing in the
closed disk of radius $R_7$ has the normal form of such a layout, so
[Lemma 22](common.md#lemma-22-the-lower-bound) gives $R \ge R_7$. $\square$
