Every case folder has the same three core files: `Construction.lean` (the
radius, the optimal packing and its centres), `Optimality.lean` (the lower
bound) and `Uniqueness.lean`, which ends with the case's `optimum`, the three
together as an `Optimum` (`Common/Optimum.lean`). Three, four and five squares add the same three
helper files for the arc argument: `Tangents.lean` (the contact polygon),
`Exterior.lean` (arcs of the squares that do not contain the disk centre) and
`Containing.lean` (the square that does). Seven squares split the pair theorem
and the equality case over the files listed [below](#seven). No case imports
another: each imports only `Common/` and its own folder.

## `Common/`

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `Basic.lean` | Vector operations, square frames and vertices, `InteriorDisjoint`, the farthest-vertex bound `phi` |
| `Tangents.lean` | Tangent identity; the octagon shared by four and five squares |
| `Separation.lean` | Hahn–Banach supporting functional for two squares with disjoint interiors |
| `Support.lean` | Octagon support for every normal; the radial sweep stays disjoint |
| `AngularBudget.lean` | `OpenArc` witnesses and the Haar-measure budget |
| `ArcMetric.lean` | Midpoint separation of disjoint arcs; circle perimeter inequality; three-arc budget |
| `Charts.lean` | `SquareChart`: membership in a square's own phase, sorted coordinates, arcs from chart intervals |
| `Coordinates.lean` | Points in a rotated frame; Cartesian chart membership; inscribed disks |
| `Regions.lean` | Disjoint regions, with the containing square replaced by its sweep; the budget for four and five squares |
| `ElementaryTrig.lean` | Arcsine and cosine estimates with exact rational constants |
| `RectangleArcs.lean` | Occupied arcs of an exterior square: the interval between its edges, and the clipped cap on small circles |
| `Constructions.lean` | Axis-parallel squares centred at given points: disjointness and containment |
| `NormalForm.lean` | Normal forms from square-by-square representations; normal forms of a packing are packings; the rigid-motion witness |
| `Optimum.lean` | `Optimum`, the statement every case proves; attainment and the converse of uniqueness for all cases |
| `Angles.lean` | Quarter turns of a frame; `m` directions pairwise at least `2π/m` apart form a regular polygon |
| `Contacts.lean` | Disjoint squares have centres at least 1 apart; equality means side-neighbours |

## The cases

| File | One | Two | Three | Four | Five | Seven |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Construction.lean` | the centred square | the 2×1 rectangle | the T | the 2×2 block | the plus | the sliding column |
| `Tangents.lean` | | | the 16-gon | the diamond | the 12-gon | |
| `Exterior.lean` | | | caps of at least `120°` and their contact types; some square contains `o` | arcs of at least `90°` at radius `1/2` | arcs over `72°` | |
| `Containing.lean` | | | deficit, compensation, overlap point | the sweep covers a quarter circle | the sweep covers a `72°` arc | |
| `Optimality.lean` | half-diagonal bound | centre-distance bound | strict 16-gon infeasibility | strict diamond infeasibility in the disk | a square centred at `o`; strict 12-gon infeasibility | six markers pairwise more than `π/3` apart |
| `Uniqueness.lean` | centred at `o` | edge to edge, `o` the midpoint | no square contains `o`; the T | `o` a vertex of every square | closed 12-gon rigidity | a regular hexagon of markers; the sliding family |

Each `Construction.lean` also defines the case's `radius`, its `centers` (the
optimal packing in the frame of its disk centre) and its `model`, the
axis-parallel squares at those centres.

## Seven

The lower bound of seven squares is spread over 44 files beside
`Construction.lean` and `Optimality.lean`, and its equality case over 6 files
in `Seven/Uniqueness/` beside `Uniqueness.lean`. By the steps of
[the proof](proof/seven.md), in import order:

| step | files | contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| construction | `Construction.lean` | the radius, the sliding column, the optimal packings |
| 2. states and markers | `Labels.lean`, `Support.lean`, `PairModel.lean` | states, labels and markers; the support function; the support sums of a canonical pair |
| 3. the marker arc | `TaylorBounds.lean`, `PolynomialCertificates.lean`, `AnalyticOrder.lean`, `ArcAnalysis.lean`, `MarkerArc.lean` | Taylor bounds for `sin` and `cos`; Bernstein certificates; calculus lemmas; the arc of half-width `801/1600` |
| 4. tools for the sectors | `SectorBounds.lean`, `Contacts.lean`, `CapReduction.lean`, `ScalarPolynomials.lean`, `LabelBoundary.lean`, `BoundarySegments.lean`, `BoundaryPointChecks.lean`, `BoundaryProfiles.lean`, `TargetProfiles.lean`, `TargetBoundaryMonotonicity.lean`, `AxialProfile.lean` | bounds on labelled states; contacts; capped labels; polynomial certificates; the boundary of the label regions and profiles along it |
| 4. the gap of `π/3` | `EasySectors.lean`, `ForwardPositive.lean`, `ForwardNegativeTarget.lean`, `ForwardBothNegative.lean`, `SideSide.lean`, `OppositeForward.lean`, `InwardTurnBounds.lean`, `InwardSideAxial.lean`, `InwardAxialAxial.lean`, `InwardSideTarget.lean`, `InwardOppositeGeometry.lean`, `InwardCircularCertificate.lean`, `InwardBoundaryMinima.lean`, `InwardOpposite.lean`, `FixedGap.lean` | the outward and backward axes, the forward axis and the inward axis, sector by sector, with their zeros, and their assembly |
| 4. all gaps | `AngularMinima.lean`, `ParallelLabels.lean`, `SmallAndParallelGaps.lean`, `NearestCornerMinimum.lean`, `AllGaps.lean` | leftmost minima; small gaps; parallel squares; smooth minima |
| 4. actual squares | `SeparatingAxes.lean`, `CanonicalPair.lean`, `MarkerSeparation.lean` | the separating-axis theorem; canonical pairs; the pair theorem |
| 1, 5. conclusion | `ExteriorSelection.lean`, `CircleBudget.lean`, `Optimality.lean` | six exterior squares; six markers form a regular hexagon; the lower bound |
| uniqueness: slots | `Uniqueness/Slots.lean` | the column as a simplex of gaps |
| uniqueness: rebuilding | `Uniqueness/SevenMarkers.lean`, `Uniqueness/ContactCycle.lean`, `Uniqueness/CenterSection.lean`, `Uniqueness/CentralSquare.lean`, `Uniqueness/Reconstruction.lean`, `Uniqueness.lean` | a square contains the disk centre; the ring of six squares; the square in the middle; the sliding layouts and the optimum |
